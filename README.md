# diabetesModel
This basic model is intended to predict wether a person might have diabetes or no
It was made using BigML, with a dataset provided by the platform. This is not a refined, accurate model, it's intended to be used only to study and practice machine learning, and not to detect wether someone might have diabetes in reality.
